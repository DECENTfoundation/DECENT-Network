/**
 * @defgroup prediction_market Prediction Market
 *
 * A prediction market is a specialized BitAsset such that total debt and total collateral are always equal amounts
 * (although asset IDs differ). No margin calls or force settlements may be performed on a prediction market asset. A
 * prediction market is globally settled by the issuer after the event being predicted resolves, thus a prediction
 * market must always have the @ref global_settle permission enabled. The maximum price for global settlement or short
 * sale of a prediction market asset is 1-to-1.
