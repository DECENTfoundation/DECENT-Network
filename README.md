Intro for new developers
------------------------
 
This is a quick introduction to get new developers up to speed on Decent.


Building Decent [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network.svg?token=xwFm8bxNLqiJV3NaNYgy&branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network)
---------------

### Installing prerequisites in Linux

For Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (for extra actions needed for 14.04 LTS, 14.10, or 16.10 see notes below), execute in console:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential autotools-dev automake autoconf libtool make cmake checkinstall realpath gcc g++ clang flex bison doxygen gettext git qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev libreadline-dev libcrypto++-dev libgmp-dev libdb-dev libdb++-dev libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libboost-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-dev libicu-dev libbz2-dev

(Ubuntu 16.10 only) Note, that the default version of Boost installed in Ubuntu 16.10 is too high and not supported. In order to install a supported one, in addition to the common commands above, execute the following in console:

    # Uninstall the default Boost and install Boost 1.60.0
    $ sudo apt-get remove libboost-all-dev
    $ sudo apt-get autoremove
    $ sudo apt-get install libboost1.60-all-dev

(Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and 14.10 only; and only boost part for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS case) Note, that the default versions of GCC, CMake, and Boost installed in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or 14.10 are too old and not supported. In order to install and use the supported ones, in addition to the common commands above, execute the following in console (in the same shell session, where you are going to build Decent itself):

    # Install GCC 5 and Clang 3.5
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install gcc-5 g++-5 clang-3.5
    # Now use either gcc-5 and g++-5, or clang-3.5 and clang++-3.5 as C and C++ compilers.
    $ export CC=gcc-5
    $ export CXX=g++-5

    # Download and build CMake 3.7.2
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ rm -rf cmake-3.7.2*
    $ wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
    $ mkdir cmake-3.7.2_prefix
    $ cd cmake-3.7.2
    $ CMAKE_ROOT=$(realpath ../cmake-3.7.2_prefix)
    $ ./configure --prefix=$CMAKE_ROOT
    $ make
    $ make install
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf cmake-3.7.2 cmake-3.7.2.tar.gz
    $ export PATH=$CMAKE_ROOT/bin:$PATH

    # Download and build Boost 1.60.0
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-third-party
    $ rm -rf boost_1_60_0* boost-1.60.0*
    $ wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.60.0/boost_1_60_0.tar.gz
    $ tar xvf boost_1_60_0.tar.gz
    $ mkdir boost-1.60.0_prefix
    $ cd boost_1_60_0
    $ export BOOST_ROOT=$(realpath ../boost-1.60.0_prefix)
    $ ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$BOOST_ROOT
    $ ./b2 install
    $ cd ..
    $ rm -rf boost_1_60_0 boost_1_60_0.tar.gz

At this point, `$CC` and `$CXX` should be set to your compilers, `cmake` command should be picked up from `$CMAKE_ROOT/bin`, and CMake configure should find the Boost distribution in the exported `$BOOST_ROOT`.


For Fedora 24 or later, execute in console:

    $ sudo dnf clean metadata
    $ sudo dnf install automake autoconf libtool make cmake gcc clang flex bison doxygen gettext-devel git qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel readline-devel cryptopp-devel gmp-devel libdb-devel libdb-cxx-devel openssl-devel libcurl-devel ncurses-devel boost-devel boost-static python-devel libicu-devel bzip2-devel

### Installing prerequisites in macOS

* Install Xcode and Command Line Tools as described in http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html
* Install Homebrew, see http://brew.sh

Then, execute in console:

    $ brew doctor
    $ brew tap homebrew/versions
    $ brew update
    $ brew install automake autoconf libtool cmake berkeley-db boost@1.60 qt5 cryptopp doxygen byacc flex gettext git pbc gmp ipfs openssl readline

### Obtaining the sources, building, and installing Decent in Unix (macOS or Linux)

After all the prerequisites are installed, execute the following commands in console, in order to clone the repo, build, and install/stage Decent:

    # Clone the repo.
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation
    $ git clone git@github.com:DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network.git
    $ cd DECENT-Network
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive

    # Build and install Decent.
    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build
    $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network
    $ cmake --build . --target all -- -j -l 3.0
    $ cmake --build . --target install

> Note that, in case of "Unix Makefiles" CMake generator, the last two commands are equivalent to:
> 
>     $ make -j -l 3.0
>     $ make install

By this time you should have Decent files installed at `~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix` directory. You can specify any other custom install prefix for `cmake` during the initial configuration, for example, by adding `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-prefix` to the command line.

You can use any path instead of `~/dev/DECENTfoundation` in the steps above.

You can use Xcode, or any other CMake generator, and then, if it is an IDE generator, instead of building and installing via `cmake` in terminal, open the generated project/solution file in the corresponding IDE and perform `ALL_BUILD` and `INSTALL` (or `install`) actions from there.

### Installing prerequisites, obtaining the sources, building, and installing Decent in Windows

TODO


Starting Decent
---------------

> In the commands below, change `~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix` to `~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-prefix` or to any other install location, that you specified during initial configuration.

On first run `witness_node` will create `witness_node_data_dir` in the current working directory, if doesn't exist already.

    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-working-dir
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-working-dir
    $ ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/witness_node

Now press Ctrl-C to stop `witness_node`.

Remove `~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-working-dir/witness_node_data_dir/blockchain` directory.
Edit `~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-working-dir/witness_node_data_dir/config.ini` to contain the following lines:

    seed-node = 185.8.165.21:33142
    rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090

Then, run the witness node again:

    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-working-dir
    $ ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/witness_node --genesis-json ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network/genesis.json --replay-blockchain

This will launch the witness node with the default genesis. Replay blockchain is a workaround, there is currently a bug than not all saved objects are restored correctly after restart. 

Then, in a separate console, start the command-line wallet by executing:

    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-working-dir
    $ ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/cli_wallet

To set your initial password to `mypassword`, execute:

    >>> set_password mypassword
    >>> unlock mypassword

To import your account keys, execute:

    >>> import_key [name] [private_wif_key]

The list of the test accounts is here:

    ejossev
    {
      "wif_priv_key": "5JntqhEuzub2DV6sD2VDLgmMCzqPxbznzBhWh2e9275PZjxPxfG",
      "pub_key": "DCT7YJyCq2VSza6BA78dzFepK3SBjW6PHBZutSRsPeddHwahTu4cy"
    }
    richard
    {
      "wif_priv_key": "5KaqD3V3tamUUq1sM68K4hBQSJjJHqBBHTJonNJ5TXrsSepWPoH",
      "pub_key": "DCT556r9dwc98LF3EjSTH3GXtUSQorcbgkKaYvND7RRfKPqCKG7dv"
    }
    vazgen
    {
      "wif_priv_key": "5JtYrTZfPBWGyfnezUJigid5FxohxWibjGihJuPEz1TKVzruYKM",
      "pub_key": "DCT5qbepojx4qATs12JT1e42Auhq457gaHSrZX2AJrmw3zBu9TUvy"
    }
    davit
    {
      "wif_priv_key": "5JFu59eMF4AQdx11QhrPchBTdF3WEp7HyMgUxRhmTEW491ofwMT",
      "pub_key": "DCT5iY4Hdj9oaJY6vGqRSMc2vqyKzrocN4o5ze8BrYBsaQC3CeAjw"
    }
    denis
    {
      "wif_priv_key": "5KbpFoPWgcsA1MMgnSzxq61GyRoGxCxwXr922HPj7L2Xev7RCob",
      "pub_key": "DCT6Ria6ZVFHNfFVrh8wBUcDubjRQ2k3UEe4bMnrPsrsaGyKPKkiF"
    }
    hayk
    {
      "wif_priv_key": "5JRPoVy5ZUX4ZxDyec78Hb7GV1424XnoD3yDKEYTWMqS4JBMB9q",
      "pub_key": "DCT5w8Hrt92G7hZmZJgMSeZGtW3tQQj8fqsJmrtffnrHyWNY7To7y"
    }

After importing the respective key(s), you will need to restart cli_wallet: use Ctrl-D to cleanly exit from it, then start it again.

There is currently a bug in cli_wallet when the keys are not imported to the internal structures right after import.

The list of cli_wallet commands is available [here](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/master/libraries/wallet/include/graphene/wallet/wallet.hpp).


Witness node
------------

The role of the witness node is to broadcast transactions, download blocks, and optionally sign them.

    $ ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build/artifacts/prefix/bin/witness_node --rpc-endpoint 127.0.0.1:8090 --enable-stale-production -w '"1.6.0"' '"1.6.1"' '"1.6.2"' '"1.6.3"' '"1.6.4"' '"1.6.5"' '"1.6.6"' '"1.6.7"' '"1.6.8"' '"1.6.9"' '"1.6.10"' 

Testing Decent
--------------

Seeder plugin is responsible for automatically announce seeder's capablity, downloading content, seeding it and distributing keys. In order to enable it follow these steps:
1. Generarate El-Gamal keys using cli_wallet command (first one is private, second one is public)

        generate_el_gamal_keys

2. Add parameters to the witness_node

        --seeder [account-id] --seeder-private-key [private_wif_key] --content-private-key [el_gamal_private_key] --packages-path [path] --seeding-price [price] --free-space [free-space]
    
    where [account-id] is one of your accounts, [private_wif_key] corresponding active key, [el_gamal_private_key] is the generated El-Gamal key, [path] is a filesystem location with at least [space] Megabytes available, and [price] is publishing price per MB per day, in satoshis.


### Coverage testing
    
Check how much code is covered by unit tests, using gcov/lcov (see http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php ).

    $ mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build
    $ cd ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network-build
    $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING=TRUE ~/dev/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network
    $ cmake --build . --target all -- -j -l 3.0
    $ cmake --build . --target install
    
    $ lcov --capture --initial --directory . --output-file base.info --no-external
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/bloom_test
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/task_cancel_test
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/api
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/blind
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/ecc_test test
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/real128_test
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/lzma_test README.md
    $ libraries/contrib/fc/ntp_test
    $ tests/intense_test
    $ tests/app_test
    $ tests/chain_bench
    $ tests/chain_test
    $ tests/performance_test
    $ lcov --capture --directory . --output-file test.info --no-external
    $ lcov --add-tracefile base.info --add-tracefile test.info --output-file total.info
    $ lcov -o interesting.info -r total.info libraries/contrib/fc/vendor/\* libraries/contrib/fc/tests/\* tests/\*
    $ mkdir -p lcov
    $ genhtml interesting.info --output-directory lcov --prefix `pwd`

Now open `lcov/index.html` in a browser.


### Unit testing

We use the Boost.Test unit test framework for unit testing.  Most unit
tests reside in the `chain_test` build target.


### Running specific tests

`$ tests/chain_tests -t block_tests/name_of_test`


Using the API
-------------

We provide several different API's.  Each API has its own ID.
When running `witness_node`, initially two API's are available:
API 0 provides read-only access to the database, while API 1 is
used to login and gain access to additional, restricted API's.

Here is an example using `wscat` package from `npm` for websockets:

    $ npm install -g wscat
    $ wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:8090
    > {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[0,"get_accounts",[["1.2.0"]]]}
    < {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_witness":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

We can do the same thing using an HTTP client such as `curl` for API's which do not require login or other session state:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "call", "params": [0, "get_accounts", [["1.2.0"]]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc
    {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_witness":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

API 0 is accessible using regular JSON-RPC:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "get_accounts", "params": [["1.2.0"]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc


Accessing restricted API's
--------------------------

You can restrict API's to particular users by specifying an `apiaccess` file in `config.ini`.  Here is an example `apiaccess` file which allows
user `bytemaster` with password `supersecret` to access four different API's, while allowing any other user to access the three public API's
necessary to use the wallet:

    {
       "permission_map" :
       [
          [
             "bytemaster",
             {
                "password_hash_b64" : "9e9GF7ooXVb9k4BoSfNIPTelXeGOZ5DrgOYMj94elaY=",
                "password_salt_b64" : "INDdM6iCi/8=",
                "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api", "network_node_api"]
             }
          ],
          [
             "*",
             {
                "password_hash_b64" : "*",
                "password_salt_b64" : "*",
                "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api"]
             }
          ]
       ]
    }

Passwords are stored in `base64` as salted `sha256` hashes.  A simple Python script, `saltpass.py` is avaliable to obtain hash and salt values from a password.
A single asterisk `"*"` may be specified as username or password hash to accept any value.

With the above configuration, here is an example of how to call `add_node` from the `network_node` API:

    {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[1,"login",["bytemaster", "supersecret"]]}
    {"id":2, "method":"call", "params":[1,"network_node",[]]}
    {"id":3, "method":"call", "params":[2,"add_node",["127.0.0.1:9090"]]}

Note, the call to `network_node` is necessary to obtain the correct API identifier for the network API.  It is not guaranteed that the network API identifier will always be `2`.

Since the `network_node` API requires login, it is only accessible over the websocket RPC.  Our `doxygen` documentation contains the most up-to-date information
about API's for the [witness node](https://bitshares.github.io/doxygen/namespacegraphene_1_1app.html) and the
[wallet](https://bitshares.github.io/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1wallet_1_1wallet__api.html).
If you want information which is not available from an API, it might be available
from the [database](https://bitshares.github.io/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1chain_1_1database.html);
it is fairly simple to write API methods to expose database methods.


Running private testnet
-----------------------

See the [documentation](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/wiki/private-testnet) if you want to run a private testnet.


Questions
---------

- Is there a way to generate help with parameter names and method descriptions?

    Yes. Documentation of the code base, including APIs, can be generated using Doxygen. Simply run `doxygen` in this directory.

    If both Doxygen and perl are available in your build environment, the CLI wallet's `help` and `gethelp`
    commands will display help generated from the doxygen documentation.

    If your CLI wallet's `help` command displays descriptions without parameter names like
        `signed_transaction transfer(string, string, string, string, string, bool)`
    it means CMake was unable to find Doxygen or perl during configuration.  If found, the
    output should look like this:
        `signed_transaction transfer(string from, string to, string amount, string asset_symbol, string memo, bool broadcast)`

- Is there a way to allow external program to drive `cli_wallet` via websocket, JSONRPC, or HTTP?

    Yes. External programs may connect to the CLI wallet and make its calls over a websockets API. To do this, run the wallet in
    server mode, i.e. `cli_wallet -s "127.0.0.1:9999"` and then have the external program connect to it over the specified port
    (in this example, port 9999).

- Is there a way to access methods which require login over HTTP?

    No.  Login is inherently a stateful process (logging in changes what the server will do for certain requests, that's kind
    of the point of having it).  If you need to track state across HTTP RPC calls, you must maintain a session across multiple
    connections.  This is a famous source of security vulnerabilities for HTTP applications.  Additionally, HTTP is not really
    designed for "server push" notifications, and we would have to figure out a way to queue notifications for a polling client.

    Websockets solves all these problems.  If you need to access Graphene's stateful methods, you need to use Websockets.

- What is the meaning of `a.b.c` numbers?

    The first number specifies the *space*.  Space 1 is for protocol objects, 2 is for implementation objects.
    Protocol space objects can appear on the wire, for example in the binary form of transactions.
    Implementation space objects cannot appear on the wire and solely exist for implementation
    purposes, such as optimization or internal bookkeeping.

    The second number specifies the *type*.  The type of the object determines what fields it has.  For a
    complete list of type ID's, see `enum object_type` and `enum impl_object_type` in
    [types.hpp](https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene/blob/master/libraries/chain/include/graphene/chain/protocol/types.hpp).

    The third number specifies the *instance*.  The instance of the object is different for each individual
    object.

- The answer to the previous question was really confusing.  Can you make it clearer?

    All account ID's are of the form `1.2.x`.  If you were the 9735th account to be registered,
    your account's ID will be `1.2.9735`.  Account `0` is special (it's the "committee account,"
    which is controlled by the committee members and has a few abilities and restrictions other accounts
    do not).

    All asset ID's are of the form `1.3.x`.  If you were the 29th asset to be registered,
    your asset's ID will be `1.3.29`.  Asset `0` is special (it's BTS, which is considered the "core asset").

    The first and second number together identify the kind of thing you're talking about (`1.2` for accounts,
    `1.3` for assets).  The third number identifies the particular thing.

- How do I get the `network_add_nodes` command to work?  Why is it so complicated?

    You need to follow the instructions in the "Accessing restricted API's" section to
    allow a username/password access to the `network_node` API.  Then you need
    to pass the username/password to the `cli_wallet` on the command line or in a config file.

    It's set up this way so that the default configuration is secure even if the RPC port is
    publicly accessible.  It's fine if your `witness_node` allows the general public to query
    the database or broadcast transactions (in fact, this is how the hosted web UI works).  It's
    less fine if your `witness_node` allows the general public to control which p2p nodes it's
    connecting to.  Therefore the API to add p2p connections needs to be set up with proper access
    controls.
