Intro for new developers
------------------------

This is a quick introduction to get new developers up to speed on DCore.

Building DCore
---------------

### Installing prerequisites in Linux

For Debian 10/Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or later, execute in console:

    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https curl gnupg lsb-release software-properties-common
    curl https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=decentfoundation | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://dl.bintray.com/decentfoundation/$(lsb_release -is | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]") $(lsb_release -cs) libpbc"
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential autotools-dev automake autoconf libtool make cmake g++ doxygen wget git qt5-default qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libreadline-dev libcrypto++-dev libgmp-dev libpbc-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-all-dev zlib1g-dev
    mkdir ~/dev

    # Download and build JSON 3.7.0
    wget -nv https://github.com/nlohmann/json/archive/v3.7.0.tar.gz
    tar xf v3.7.0.tar.gz
    cd json-3.7.0
    cmake .
    sudo make -j$(nproc) install
    cd ..
    rm -rf json-3.7.0 v3.7.0.tar.gz

For Fedora 29 or later, execute in console:

    sudo dnf install curl
    sudo curl https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=decentfoundation -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-decentfoundation
    sudo curl https://docs.decent.ch/assets/bintray-decentfoundation.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/bintray-decentfoundation.repo
    sudo dnf install automake autoconf libtool make cmake gcc-c++ doxygen wget git qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-linguist readline-devel cryptopp-devel openssl-devel gmp-devel libpbc-devel libcurl-devel json-devel zlib-devel boost-devel boost-static
    mkdir ~/dev

> Note for Debian 9/Ubuntu 16.04 LTS legacy systems, the default versions of Boost and CMake installed are too old and not supported. In order to install a supported ones, in addition to the common commands above, execute the following in console (in the same shell session, where you are going to build DCore itself):

    # Download and build Boost 1.65.1
     wget -nv https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.65.1/boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
     tar xf boost_1_65_1.tar.gz
     mkdir boost
     cd boost_1_65_1
     export BOOST_ROOT=$(realpath ../boost)
     ./bootstrap.sh --prefix=$BOOST_ROOT
     ./b2 -j$(nproc) install
     cd ..
     rm -rf boost_1_65_1 boost_1_65_1.tar.gz

    # Download and build CMake 3.13.4
     wget -nv https://cmake.org/files/v3.13/cmake-3.13.4.tar.gz
     tar xf cmake-3.13.4.tar.gz
     mkdir cmake
     cd cmake-3.13.4
     export CMAKE_ROOT=$(realpath ../cmake)
     ./configure --prefix=$CMAKE_ROOT
     make -j$(nproc) install
     export PATH=$CMAKE_ROOT/bin:$PATH
     cd ..
     rm -rf cmake-3.13.4 cmake-3.13.4.tar.gz

### Installing prerequisites in MacOS

* Install Xcode and Command Line Tools as described in http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html
* Install Homebrew, see http://brew.sh

Then, execute in console:

    $ brew update
    $ brew install automake autoconf libtool cmake boost cryptopp openssl pbc qt readline doxygen git ipfs
    $ brew tap nlohmann/json
    $ brew install nlohmann_json --with-cmake
    $ brew link --force readline
    $ mkdir ~/dev

> Note that, if you want to use OpenSSL 1.1 change the `openssl` argument to `openssl@1.1` in the install command line (see also note in building step).

### Installing prerequisites in Windows

* Install Git for Windows (https://gitforwindows.org)
* Install CMake tools (https://cmake.org/download)
* Install Visual Studio 2017 Community (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads)
* Install Boost 1.68 MSVC 14.1 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries) (choose *C:\Projects\boost_1_68_0* as installation prefix)
* Install Qt 5.12.4 (https://www.qt.io) for MSVC 14.1 x64 (choose *C:\Projects\Qt* as installation prefix)
* Install Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) (choose *C:\Doxygen* as installation prefix)
* Install Perl (http://strawberryperl.com) (choose *C:\Strawberry* as installation prefix)

Then, start _Visual Studio 2017 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt_ and execute:

    mkdir \Projects
    cd \Projects
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    vcpkg --triplet x64-windows-static install cryptopp curl openssl pbc nlohmann-json

### Obtaining the sources

After all the prerequisites are installed, execute in console (change current path to `~/dev` in Linux/MacOS or to `\Projects` in Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/DECENTfoundation/DECENT-Network.git
    cd DECENT-Network
    git submodule update --init --recursive

### Building and installing DCore in Linux or MacOS

In order to build and install DCore, execute in console:

    mkdir -p ~/dev/DECENT-Network-build
    cd ~/dev/DECENT-Network-build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ~/dev/DECENT-Network
    cmake --build . --target all -- -j -l 3.0
    cmake --build . --target install

> Note for MacOS, if you want to use OpenSSL 1.1 you have to add `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1` to the `cmake` command line during the initial configuration.

> Note that, in case of "Unix Makefiles" CMake generator, the last two commands are equivalent to:
>
>     $ make -j -l 3.0 install

DCore artifacts are installed at `/usr/local` directory by default. You can specify any other custom install prefix for `cmake` during the initial configuration, for example, by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/dev/DECENT-Network-prefix` to the command line.

You can use any path instead of `~/dev` in the steps above.

You can use Xcode, or any other CMake generator, and then, if it is an IDE generator, instead of building and installing via `cmake` in terminal, open the generated project/solution file in the corresponding IDE and perform `ALL_BUILD` and `INSTALL` (or `install`) actions from there.

### Building and installing DCore in Windows

In order to build and install DCore follow the steps:
* start Visual Studio 2017, navigate to _File > Open > Folder_ and choose `C:\Projects\DECENT-Network`
* navigate to _CMake > Change CMake Settings > DCore_ and adjust installation prefix and paths to Boost, Qt, Doxygen, Perl and vcpkg (if needed)
* build and install artifacts using _CMake > Install > DCore_

You can use CMake generator to create a Visual Studio 2017 project files and perform _Build > Build solution_ action from there, just start the _Visual Studio 2017 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt_ and execute:

    cd \Projects\DECENT-Network
    set BOOST=C:\Projects\boost_1_68_0
    set QT_CMAKE=C:\Projects\Qt\5.12.4\msvc2017_64\lib\cmake
    set DOXYGEN=C:\Doxygen
    set PERL=C:\Strawberry\perl
    set VCPKG=C:\Projects\vcpkg
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG%\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%DOXYGEN%;%PERL% -DBOOST_ROOT=%BOOST% -DBOOST_LIBRARYDIR=%BOOST%\lib64-msvc-14.1 -DQt5Widgets_DIR=%QT_CMAKE%\Qt5Widgets -DQt5LinguistTools_DIR=%QT_CMAKE%\Qt5LinguistTools -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" .

You can specify any other custom install prefix for `cmake` during the initial configuration, for example, by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Projects\DECENT-Network-prefix` to the command line.

You can use any path instead of `C:\Projects` in the steps above.

Building DCore in Docker
-------------------------

You can also build Docker image which will run as DCore network node. Image will be based on either Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora Linux, for the details go to [Docker](https://github.com/DECENTfoundation/DCore-Docker/blob/master/README.md) repository.

Starting DCore
---------------

> In the commands below, change `/usr/local` to `~/dev/DECENT-Network-prefix` or to any other install location, that you specified during initial configuration.

On first run `decentd` will create `.decent` in the home directory, if doesn't exist already.

    $ /usr/local/bin/decentd

Optionally, now press Ctrl-C to stop `decentd`. You can edit configuration in `~/.decent/data/decentd/config.ini`.

Then, run the DCore daemon again:

    $ /usr/local/bin/decentd

This will launch the DCore daemon node with the default genesis.

Then, in a separate console, start the command-line wallet by executing:

    $ cd ~/dev/DECENT-Network-working-dir
    $ /usr/local/bin/cli_wallet

To set your initial password to `mypassword`, execute:

    >>> set_password mypassword
    >>> unlock mypassword

To import your account keys, execute:

    >>> import_key [name] [private_wif_key]

DCore daemon
--------------

The role of the DCore daemon is to broadcast transactions, download blocks, and optionally sign them.

    $ /usr/local/bin/decentd --rpc-endpoint 127.0.0.1:8090 --enable-stale-production -w '"1.4.0"'

Testing DCore
--------------

Seeder plugin is responsible for automatically announce seeder's capablity, downloading content, seeding it and distributing keys. In order to enable it follow these steps:
1. Generarate El-Gamal keys using cli_wallet command (first one is private, second one is public)

        generate_el_gamal_keys

2. Add parameters to the DCore daemon

        --seeder [account-id] --seeder-private-key [private_wif_key] --content-private-key [el_gamal_private_key] --packages-path [path] --seeding-price [price] --free-space [free-space]

    where [account-id] is one of your accounts, [private_wif_key] corresponding active key, [el_gamal_private_key] is the generated El-Gamal key, [path] is a filesystem location with at least [space] Megabytes available, and [price] is publishing price per MB per day, in satoshis.


Using the API
-------------

We provide several different API's.  Each API has its own ID.
When running `decentd`, initially two API's are available:
API 0 provides read-only access to the database, while API 1 is
used to login and gain access to additional, restricted API's.

Here is an example using `wscat` package from `npm` for websockets:

    $ npm install -g wscat
    $ wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:8090
    > {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[0,"get_accounts",[["1.2.0"]]]}
    < {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_miner":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

We can do the same thing using an HTTP client such as `curl` for API's which do not require login or other session state:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "call", "params": [0, "get_accounts", [["1.2.0"]]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc
    {"id":1,"result":[{"id":"1.2.0","annotations":[],"membership_expiration_date":"1969-12-31T23:59:59","registrar":"1.2.0","referrer":"1.2.0","lifetime_referrer":"1.2.0","network_fee_percentage":2000,"lifetime_referrer_fee_percentage":8000,"referrer_rewards_percentage":0,"name":"committee-account","owner":{"weight_threshold":1,"account_auths":[],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"active":{"weight_threshold":6,"account_auths":[["1.2.5",1],["1.2.6",1],["1.2.7",1],["1.2.8",1],["1.2.9",1],["1.2.10",1],["1.2.11",1],["1.2.12",1],["1.2.13",1],["1.2.14",1]],"key_auths":[],"address_auths":[]},"options":{"memo_key":"GPH1111111111111111111111111111111114T1Anm","voting_account":"1.2.0","num_miner":0,"num_committee":0,"votes":[],"extensions":[]},"statistics":"2.7.0","whitelisting_accounts":[],"blacklisting_accounts":[]}]}

API 0 is accessible using regular JSON-RPC:

    $ curl --data '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "get_accounts", "params": [["1.2.0"]], "id": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:8090/rpc


Accessing restricted API's
--------------------------

You can restrict API's to particular users by specifying an `api-access` file in `config.ini`.  Here is an example `apiaccess` file which allows
user `decent` with password `pwd` to access four different API's, while allowing any other user to access the three public API's
necessary to use the wallet:

    {
       "permission_map" :
       [
          [
             "decent",
             {
                "password_hash_b64" : "W/wGhp3F9QOPwyCCpAPSQTrRnoQJi7IrI98ttwCJwCE=",
                "password_salt_b64" : "8Bd7FkJHI/8=",
                "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api", "network_node_api"]
             }
          ],
          [
             "*",
             {
                "password_hash_b64" : "*",
                "password_salt_b64" : "*",
                "allowed_apis" : ["database_api", "network_broadcast_api", "history_api"]
             }
          ]
       ]
    }

Passwords are stored in `base64` as salted `sha256` hashes.  A simple Python script, `saltpass.py` is avaliable to obtain hash and salt values from a password.
A single asterisk `"*"` may be specified as username or password hash to accept any value.

With the above configuration, here is an example of how to call `add_node` from the `network_node` API:

    {"id":1, "method":"call", "params":[1,"login",["bytemaster", "supersecret"]]}
    {"id":2, "method":"call", "params":[1,"network_node",[]]}
    {"id":3, "method":"call", "params":[2,"add_node",["127.0.0.1:9090"]]}

Note, the call to `network_node` is necessary to obtain the correct API identifier for the network API.  It is not guaranteed that the network API identifier will always be `2`.


Questions
---------

- Is there a way to generate help with parameter names and method descriptions?

    Yes. Documentation of the code base, including APIs, can be generated using Doxygen. Simply run `doxygen` in this directory.

    If both Doxygen and perl are available in your build environment, the CLI wallet's `help` and `gethelp`
    commands will display help generated from the doxygen documentation.

    If your CLI wallet's `help` command displays descriptions without parameter names like
        `signed_transaction transfer(string, string, string, string, string, bool)`
    it means CMake was unable to find Doxygen or perl during configuration.  If found, the
    output should look like this:
        `signed_transaction transfer(string from, string to, string amount, string asset_symbol, string memo, bool broadcast)`

- Is there a way to allow external program to drive `cli_wallet` via websocket, JSONRPC, or HTTP?

    Yes. External programs may connect to the CLI wallet and make its calls over a websockets API. To do this, run the wallet in
    server mode, i.e. `cli_wallet -s "127.0.0.1:9999"` and then have the external program connect to it over the specified port
    (in this example, port 9999).

- Is there a way to access methods which require login over HTTP?

    No.  Login is inherently a stateful process (logging in changes what the server will do for certain requests, that's kind
    of the point of having it).  If you need to track state across HTTP RPC calls, you must maintain a session across multiple
    connections.  This is a famous source of security vulnerabilities for HTTP applications.  Additionally, HTTP is not really
    designed for "server push" notifications, and we would have to figure out a way to queue notifications for a polling client.

    Websockets solves all these problems.  If you need to access DCore's stateful methods, you need to use Websockets.

- What is the meaning of `a.b.c` numbers?

    The first number specifies the *space*.  Space 1 is for protocol objects, 2 is for implementation objects.
    Protocol space objects can appear on the wire, for example in the binary form of transactions.
    Implementation space objects cannot appear on the wire and solely exist for implementation
    purposes, such as optimization or internal bookkeeping.

    The second number specifies the *type*.  The type of the object determines what fields it has.  For a complete
    list of type ID's, see `enum local_object_type`, `enum protocol_object_type` and `enum impl_object_type` in `types.hpp`.

    The third number specifies the *instance*.  The instance of the object is different for each individual object.

- The answer to the previous question was really confusing.  Can you make it clearer?

    All account ID's are of the form `1.2.x`.  If you were the 9735th account to be registered,
    your account's ID will be `1.2.9735`.  Account `0` is special (it's the "committee account,"
    which is controlled by the committee members and has a few abilities and restrictions other accounts
    do not).

    All asset ID's are of the form `1.3.x`.  If you were the 29th asset to be registered,
    your asset's ID will be `1.3.29`.  Asset `0` is special (it's DCT, which is considered the "core asset").

    The first and second number together identify the kind of thing you're talking about (`1.2` for accounts,
    `1.3` for assets).  The third number identifies the particular thing.

- How do I get the `network_add_nodes` command to work?  Why is it so complicated?

    You need to follow the instructions in the "Accessing restricted API's" section to
    allow a username/password access to the `network_node` API.  Then you need
    to pass the username/password to the `cli_wallet` on the command line or in a config file.

    It's set up this way so that the default configuration is secure even if the RPC port is
    publicly accessible.  It's fine if your `decentd` allows the general public to query
    the database or broadcast transactions (in fact, this is how the hosted web UI works).  It's
    less fine if your `decent` allows the general public to control which p2p nodes it's
    connecting to.  Therefore the API to add p2p connections needs to be set up with proper access
    controls.
